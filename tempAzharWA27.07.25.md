[3/4/2025 10:56 PM] b1tranger: @Faias Sattar Sir (UITS Faculty)  any suggestions for me? Should I focus on my academics for now?
[3/4/2025 11:03 PM] Hasib Al Mahmud Siddique (UITS 54B): Sir i am researching about ML at this point. 
After i have a basic understanding of this topic I will look into research papers.Ramadan week has been hectic for all of us.Inshallah I will give you an update on Thursday
[3/4/2025 11:03 PM] Hasib Al Mahmud Siddique (UITS 54B): Sorry for the delay @Faias Sattar Sir (UITS Faculty) sir
[3/4/2025 11:08 PM] Masud Ur Rahman (UITS BBN Bashundhara G Block): Yes, sir. I am currently learning about machine learning and would like a clear starting point. Unless I fully understand the basic concepts, I don’t think I will be able to improve any methods or even meaningfully comprehend a research paper.
It’s getting a bit challenging to balance my academic routine with skill development while also trying to decide on a specific research paper to read. I will give you a comprehensive update on Thursday
[3/4/2025 11:26 PM] Mehedi (UITS 54B): Assalam walakium,sir
While Im lacking in skills and dedication in contrast to my peers, I do have a certain idea of a project it is quite far fetched and quite overwhelming at this state for me but Im working on it. 
My Idea is to create a system(generative ai) or a machine using iot that will  help organize household belongings efficiently by analyzing available space and suggesting optimal furniture arrangements.
I have been trying to study a research paper but Im at such a novice state that I need to note keyterms that they are using and go learn them or have some Idea and go back read again, it will take a while for me to comprehend this, sorry for my incompetency but hope I can bring something out of this.
[3/4/2025 11:52 PM] Zobayer✨ (UITS B51): Seems a really interesting project to me, if you need help in finding any basic ML/AI related learning resource feel free to inbox me.

Keep trying ✨
[3/5/2025 9:04 AM] Fahim Hossain (UITS 54 B): Sir, I am really sorry for the late reply. I wasn’t feeling well and was asleep at that time. I will give update tomorrow.
[3/5/2025 10:50 AM] Akash Sir (UITS Faculty): A conventional optimization algorithm will probably be more suitable for this instead of ml. We need to hear about it in detail.
[3/5/2025 2:00 PM] Adnan bhai (Tahsan Arafat) (UITS B54-B): @Arnab sir (Ayanava Paul) (UITS Faculty) sir 
I am currently figuring out in which field, should I pursue. At first, I was looking for block-chain related topics. But the articles were ether way out of date (but still advance for me because there are limited resources in youtube which I prefer for initial info collection) or way advanced. Akash sir proposed for those who were interested in block-chain, He'll arrange sort of a boot-camp about block-chain in future ( hopefully soon). As pretty much inexperience in all the fields and with a vast lack of basic knowledge about these fields it's a bit challenging to choose a specific field. Currently I'm gathering basic info about all the things which I think will be necessary for research. I'm currently studying about quantum computing at a surface level. I've some questions regarding AI related fields. I'll give an update at our next meeting.
[3/6/2025 12:58 PM] Mehedi (UITS 54B): @Faias Sattar Sir (UITS Faculty) sir apni ki Department e achen?
[3/6/2025 1:05 PM] Fahim Hossain (UITS 54 B): @Arnab sir (Ayanava Paul) (UITS Faculty)
[3/6/2025 1:42 PM] Monika Apu (UITS 54 A): @Arnab sir (Ayanava Paul) (UITS Faculty) Sorry, Sir. I wasn’t feeling well, so I couldn’t reply earlier. I also missed the last meeting. I am still confused  about which field would be the best fit for me, so I would like to take a little more time to decide.

[3/6/2025 11:45 PM] Akib Reza (UITS): @Akash Sir (UITS Faculty) sir, 

i'm trying to make a machine learning project for my software engineering and system analysis course.

The project is about real estate recommendation. 

Basically the user will describe what type of property they want and through natural language processing a structured data will be created. (This part is already done)

the next part that needs to be done is comparing this data  with a large amount of property data which already exists in the database. After comparing i want to display the properties that has scored highest when compared to user's data. 

For this scoring system, i've heard of many options. "regression model", "cosine similarity", "k-nearest neighbor" . I dont have idea about any of this and i dont know which option to choose as a beginner. Could you please recommend how i can make this functionality?
[3/6/2025 11:46 PM] Akash Sir (UITS Faculty): First of all, this is brilliant work!
[3/6/2025 11:46 PM] Akash Sir (UITS Faculty): Very well done.
[3/6/2025 11:49 PM] Akash Sir (UITS Faculty): For the next part, it will be smarter to design your own property ranking system.
[3/6/2025 11:52 PM] Akash Sir (UITS Faculty): kNN sounds like a good idea. However, as your database is a mix of categorical and numerical values, we need to design a custom distance function.
[3/6/2025 11:55 PM] Akash Sir (UITS Faculty): Come meet me next sunday, we can talk about it in detail. In the mean time, read up on kNN algorithm.
[3/6/2025 11:56 PM] Akib Reza (UITS): Thank you sir

Some of us had to leave early today because of the bad traffic jam situation thats why we couldn’t wait.Sir we also wanted to meet you last Thursday but we couldn’t find you.
 If you could spare us some time tomorrow it would be really helpful for us as we need some guidance on how to persue ML.
[3/10/2025 6:48 PM] Akash Sir (UITS Faculty): Understandable. Come meet us later this week.

"In a historic breakthrough, China’s Jiuzhang quantum computer solved a problem in four minutes that would take the world’s fastest supercomputer billions of years! This photonic quantum computer uses Gaussian boson sampling, detecting and counting 76 photons—a feat impossible for classical computers.
The advancements continued with Jiuzhang 2.0 (113 photons) and Jiuzhang 3.0 (255 photons), making calculations at speeds millions of times faster than traditional supercomputers. These breakthroughs could transform fields like quantum chemistry, cryptography, AI, and even drug discovery.
Unlike conventional computers that rely on binary bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers leverage superposition and entanglement, unlocking unprecedented processing power. Scientists predict that quantum computing could revolutionize problem-solving, enabling discoveries we once thought impossible.
The future of computing is unfolding before our eyes!"
