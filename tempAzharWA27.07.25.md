[3/4/2025 3:35 PM] Akash Sir: You should register
[3/4/2025 10:23 PM] Arnab: @Fahim Hossain (UITS 54 B) give update
[3/4/2025 10:27 PM] Akash Sir: @Faias Sattar  You were supposed to send me a paper.
[3/4/2025 10:27 PM] Akash Sir: Adversarial Learning.
[3/4/2025 10:28 PM] Arnab: give some links or good paper on FL
[3/4/2025 10:29 PM] Faias Sattar : https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12792
[3/4/2025 10:33 PM] Faias Sattar : @b1tranger it's been many days. Have you come up with anything?
[3/4/2025 10:34 PM] Arnab: @Adnan bhai (Tahsan Arafat) (UITS B54-B) @Monika Apu (UITS 54 A) @Masud Ur Rahman (UITS BBN Bashundhara G Block)  give update
[3/4/2025 10:34 PM] Faias Sattar : @Hasib Al Mahmud Siddique (UITS 54B) what about you guys?
[3/4/2025 10:35 PM] Arnab: @~Azher give update
[3/4/2025 10:36 PM] b1tranger: I have received a personal project from Akash sir, but nothing significant on the research part.
[3/4/2025 10:37 PM] Faias Sattar : Why?
[3/4/2025 10:39 PM] b1tranger: I have 4 CTs this week, and maybe not coping well in the first week of Ramadan
[3/4/2025 10:56 PM] b1tranger: @Faias Sattar any suggestions for me? Should I focus on my academics for now?
[3/4/2025 11:52 PM] Zobayer✨: Seems a really interesting project to me, if you need help in finding any basic ML/AI related learning resource feel free to inbox me.

Keep trying ✨
[3/5/2025 10:50 AM] Akash Sir: A conventional optimization algorithm will probably be more suitable for this instead of ml. We need to hear about it in detail.

[3/6/2025 11:45 PM] Akib Reza: @Akash Sir sir, 

i'm trying to make a machine learning project for my software engineering and system analysis course.

The project is about real estate recommendation. 

Basically the user will describe what type of property they want and through natural language processing a structured data will be created. (This part is already done)

the next part that needs to be done is comparing this data  with a large amount of property data which already exists in the database. After comparing i want to display the properties that has scored highest when compared to user's data. 

For this scoring system, i've heard of many options. "regression model", "cosine similarity", "k-nearest neighbor" . I dont have idea about any of this and i dont know which option to choose as a beginner. Could you please recommend how i can make this functionality?
[3/6/2025 11:46 PM] Akash Sir: First of all, this is brilliant work!
[3/6/2025 11:46 PM] Akash Sir: Very well done.
[3/6/2025 11:49 PM] Akash Sir: For the next part, it will be smarter to design your own property ranking system.
[3/6/2025 11:52 PM] Akash Sir: kNN sounds like a good idea. However, as your database is a mix of categorical and numerical values, we need to design a custom distance function.
[3/6/2025 11:55 PM] Akash Sir: Come meet me next sunday, we can talk about it in detail. In the mean time, read up on kNN algorithm.
[3/6/2025 11:56 PM] Akib Reza: Thank you sir
